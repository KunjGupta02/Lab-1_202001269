# Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
## Ans.
### Scope: 
    About 5% of World's Population(466 million people) suffers from a hearing impairment. It consist of people of all age groups including kids and old age people. By using this AI, these people can recognise several noises in their surroundings through the AI in their phone. As soon as the AI detects the car horn or babies crying, it alerts the user. It monitors the environment in real time and enables users to hear sounds and alerts via display.      

### Features:
    1. User friendly UI, so that even old people and kids can use this AI. Simple interface attracts large number of users.
    2. AI should be real time and notify user via sound/message as soon as it detects. If AI is not quick, then it is of no use to user.
    3. AI should be smart enough to recognize different sounds and distinguish which sound to alert.

### Non- functional aspects:
